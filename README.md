# Mobile Coding Challenge: Cuong-Notes

This SwiftUI note application provides a simple interface for users to create and manage notes. Leveraging the power of SwiftUI for a modern and responsive UI, the app connects to Firebase Realtime Database to enable real-time synchronization of notes across devices.

## Architecture
This application is applied the **Clean Architecture**: https://blog.cleancoder.com/uncle-bob/2012/08/13/the-clean-architecture.html 
### Layers
* **Domain Layer** = Entities + Use Cases + Repositories Interfaces
* **Data Repositories Layer** = Repositories Implementations + FirebaseDatabase ( or API Network/Persistence DB) 
* **Presentation Layer (MVVM)** = ViewModels + Views (Written in SwiftUI)

### Dependency Direction
![Alt text](CleanArchitectureDependencies.png?raw=true "Modules Dependencies")

**Note:** **Domain Layer** should not include anything from other layers(e.g Presentation â€” SwiftUI or Data Layer)

## Networking
The application utilizes Firebase Realtime Database to synchronize notes in real-time, ensuring that any updates or additions are reflected instantly across all devices. It does not require users to login. 
* **FirebaseDatabaseManager:** A Singleton is reponsible for Firebase configurations. It wraps **DatabaseReference** up and provides **CRUD Operations**
* **FirebaseDatabaseEndpoint** The endpoint provides information such as the path and the synced data flag for operations.
